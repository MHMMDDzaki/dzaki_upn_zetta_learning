                The story of Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat which
                is home to seven major nations: Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru,
                Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya. These nations are ruled over by
                deities known as Archons, part of a group of gods called "The Seven."
                Each Archon is associated with one of the seven elements of Teyvat,
                which are also reflected in their nation's landscape and culture. For
                example, the nation of Mondstadt is ruled over by Barbatos the Anemo
                Archon, and so the element of wind is an important symbol known by its
                people. Apart from the seven nations, there was the nation of
                Khaenri'ah that lived independently from the authority of gods.<br /><br />

                Celestia is the main heavenly body that presides over Teyvat and is in
                direct connection with The Seven. A floating island seen in the sky is
                believed to be it, allegedly the home to gods and also mortals who
                have ascended to godhood. Humans that are granted Visions, magical
                gems that grant bearers the ability to command elemental power, are
                called "allogenes" â€” ones with the potential to reach godhood.<br /><br />

                While gods rule, the nations also have their own human governing
                bodies: the Knights of Favonius to Mondstadt, the Qixing to Liyue, the
                Shogunate to Inazuma, and the Akademiya to Sumeru.
